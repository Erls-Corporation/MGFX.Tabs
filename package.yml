#   - { package: 'http://external-plugin.com' }	

# For dependencies of projects that are *already* in the forge, use the plugin slug (for example some-plugin for Some Plugin) for "package", and the version of the foreign plugin that yours is known to work with in "version". For external dependencies, just use the URL.
